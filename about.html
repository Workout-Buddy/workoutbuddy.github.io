            <h2 class="question-about">How was our team formed ?</h2>
            <p class="intro-about">
                Our team was formed through a group project in the SEG2900 course at the University of Ottawa.
                The goal was to come up with a product and then create a website to market that product.
                Through this project, we were able to develop our web development skills by learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                Our team consists of six students from the University of Ottawa : four software engineering students and two 
                computer science students.
